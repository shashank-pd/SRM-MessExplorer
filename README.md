# SRM's Mess Menu

## 🍽️Introduction

This project aims to simplify the daily dining experience for students at SRM University. 
Often, students are unaware of the mess menu, leading to uncertainty about available meals. 
To address this, the SRM's Mess Menu website provides an easy-to-use platform for students to view the daily menu and meal timings.

## 📋Description

The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in this repository create a user-friendly webpage that dynamically displays the current day's mess menu and timings. The page includes a real-time clock showing the current time, enhancing the overall user experience.

The page not only displays the menu for the current day but also allows users to navigate to other days using the "Previous" and "Next" buttons.

## ✨Features
